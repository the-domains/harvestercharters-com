  There's been a lot of discussion on our message boards about offshore fishing
  this week and it seems like the comments fall into one of two categories. The
  first group are those who say the fishing sucks and are often the same ones
  who blame the purse seiners for the lack of catchable tuna within skiff range
  of the coast.
